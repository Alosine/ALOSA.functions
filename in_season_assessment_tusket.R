#
# in_season_assessment_tusket.R
# 
# This function is meant to be run in season to generate estimates of escapement
# at the fish ladders for Vaughan Dam and the Powerhouse on the Tusket River.
# The season setup section only needs to be run the first time to generate the
# files that will be used throughout the season.
# The plotting sections in this script are meant to be catered to the data as
# the season develops. They might work as is, but will likely need tinkering
# to look any good.
#
# Arguments:
#
# year = integer; the year that you wish to analyse; defaults to current year
#
# powerhouse = Boolean; whether or not you wish to include observations from the
# ladder at the Powerhouse. This can only be TRUE for years >= 2022 as no
# observations were made prior to this.
#
# output_folder = character; folder where the plots should go
# 
# new_season = Boolean; whether or not you wish to create the blank CSVs that 
# hold the count observations. We only do this at the beginning of the season.
